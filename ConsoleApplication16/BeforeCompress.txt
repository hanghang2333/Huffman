Good afternoon, it is my pleasure to have the opportunity to be here. I would like to answer whatever you may raise. And I hope I can make a good performance today, eventually enroll in this prestigious university in September. First of all, I¡¯d like to introduce myself to you.
My name is LiHang, graduated from Tian Jin University. My major is communication engineering, Four years university education gives me a lot of things to learn, a lot of chances to try, and a lot of practices to improve myself. It teaches me not only what to study and how to think, but also to see the importance of practical ability. I have mastered all the core courses of engineering as well as the specialized courses of communication engineering and build up a solid foundation of professional knowledge. I have ever taken part in the scientific research, and acquired basic knowledge of packaging both in theory and in practice.
What is more, I¡¯m good at analysis. Innovation and have a strong sense of cooperation. And my friendly temperament, the emotion of sincerity and the style of diligence make either teacher or classmates like me very much. I feel that my strongest asset is my ability to stick to things to get them done. I have broad interests like many other youngers. I like reading books, listening to music and so on.
Although I have broad interests in many aspects and grasp the essential knowledge of the major, but I think at present, I can do many things in a superficial level, but not be competent to do things professionally owing to lack of ample knowledge and ability. So I think further study is still urgent for me to realize self-value.
I really appreciate it if you could consider my application. If I could have the honor to study here, I promise that I could never fail your expectation. I¡¯ll try my best to study and learn as much as I could to make contributions to the society and our country.   
That's all. Thank you very much for your time and attention.

I have mastered all the core courses of engineering as well as the specialized courses of communication engineering and build up a solid foundation of professional knowledge. I have ever taken part in the scientific research, and acquired basic knowledge of packaging both in theory and in practice.
What is more, I¡¯m good at analysis. Innovation and have a strong sense of cooperation. And my friendly temperament, the emotion of sincerity and the style of diligence make either teacher or classmates like me very much. I feel that my strongest asset is my ability to stick to things to get them done. I have broad interests like many other youngers. I like reading books, listening to music and so on.
Although I have broad interests in many aspects and grasp the essential knowledge of the major, but I think at present, I can do many things in a superficial level, but not be competent to do things professionally owing to lack of ample knowledge and ability. So I think further study is still urgent for me to realize self-value.
I really appreciate it if you could consider my application. If I could have the honor to study here, I promise that I could never fail your expectation. I¡¯ll try my best to study and learn as much as I could to make contributions to the society and our country.   
That's all. Thank you very much for your time and attention.
